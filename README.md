# Project 1 - Data Modeling with Postgresql

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to help a music streaming startup called Sparkify better understand their users' listening habits. Sparkify's user base has been growing exponentially, and needs a database and analytics solution that will be able to scale and keep up with its rapid growth. We will be using Apache Cassandra, a NOSQL database, to power Sparkify's back-end and at the same time, use it to derive meaningful insights for the analytics team. 


## The Raw Data


The raw data logs come in the form of CSV files, containing records of song plays. Below is the schema of the CSV log file, named `event_datafile_new.csv`:

|column_name|description|data_type|
